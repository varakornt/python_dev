#Python Projects
1. Password Generator: Create a script that generates strong passwords. This project will teach you about the importance of strong passwords and how they can be generated using Python.

2. Directory Scanner: Develop a tool that scans directories on a website to find hidden or non-listed files. This project will help you understand how web directories are structured and how to automate requests using Python.

3. Port Scanner: Write a script that scans ports of a given IP address to find open ports. This is a fundamental skill in ethical hacking, as open ports can be gateways for attackers.

4. Keylogger: Build a simple keylogger that records keystrokes and saves them to a file. While creating a keylogger, you'll learn about event handling and file manipulation in Python. Remember, use this project only for educational purposes and ethical hacking practice within a legal framework.

5. Encryptor/Decryptor Tool: Create a tool that can encrypt and decrypt files. This project will introduce you to cryptography and how it's implemented in Python.

6. Simple Packet Sniffer: Work on a script that can sniff network packets. This introduces you to network programming and gives insights into how data is transmitted over networks. Use libraries like Scapy or PyShark for this project.

7. Web Scraper for Vulnerability Feeds: Develop a web scraper that collects information about the latest vulnerabilities from websites like CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures). This will teach you web scraping and how to work with APIs.

8. SQL Injection Vulnerability Scanner: Create a scanner that checks websites for SQL injection vulnerabilities. This project will help you understand how SQL injections work and how they can be detected.

9. Brute Force Login Page: Write a script that attempts to log in to a web page using brute force. This project should be done in an ethical manner, targeting only your own applications or applications you have explicit permission to test.

10. Network Traffic Analyzer: Develop a tool that analyzes network traffic to identify suspicious activities. This project can introduce you to the concepts of network security and analysis.
